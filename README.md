# Dynamic Knowledge Graph Builder

## Overview

The Dynamic Knowledge Graph Builder is an innovative framework that leverages AI-powered natural language processing to construct, update, and manage knowledge graphs from unstructured text data in real-time. By combining the power of large language models with graph database technology, this tool offers a novel approach to information extraction and representation.

## Key Features

- Real-time processing of news articles and text data
- AI-powered entity and relationship extraction using Google's Gemini API
- Dynamic knowledge graph construction and visualization
- Flexible and adaptable to various domains and data sources

## Novel Approach

Our framework stands out by:

1. Utilizing state-of-the-art language models for advanced NLP tasks, enabling the extraction of complex entities and relationships that might be missed by traditional NLP techniques.
2. Providing real-time processing capabilities, allowing the knowledge graph to be continuously updated as new information becomes available.
3. Offering a flexible architecture that can be easily adapted to different domains and types of text input.

## Use Cases

1. **Business Intelligence**: Track competitors, market trends, and customer sentiment in real-time.
2. **Research and Academia**: Map relationships between research papers, authors, and concepts to discover new connections in scientific literature.
3. **Journalism**: Quickly understand complex stories and their context by visualizing connections between people, organizations, and events.
4. **Financial Analysis**: Monitor relationships between companies, executives, and financial events to gain insights into market dynamics.
5. **Legal Research**: Map relationships between cases, laws, and legal entities to identify precedents and connections in large volumes of legal documents.

## Integration with Neo4j

While the current implementation uses NetworkX for graph representation, the framework is designed to be easily integrated with Neo4j for enhanced performance and scalability:

1. **Faster Search**: Neo4j's native graph storage and processing capabilities allow for lightning-fast traversal and querying of complex relationships.
2. **Scalability**: Neo4j can handle billions of nodes and relationships, making it suitable for large-scale knowledge graphs.
3. **Real-time Updates**: Neo4j's ACID-compliant transactions ensure data consistency when updating the knowledge graph in real-time.

To integrate with Neo4j, simply replace the NetworkX graph operations with Neo4j Cypher queries in the `GraphManager` class.

## Recommendation Engine Potential

The knowledge graph built by this framework can serve as a powerful foundation for a recommendation engine:

1. **Content-based Recommendations**: Suggest articles or content based on the entities and relationships a user has shown interest in.
2. **Collaborative Filtering**: Identify users with similar interests by analyzing their interaction patterns with entities in the knowledge graph.
3. **Knowledge-based Recommendations**: Leverage the rich relationships in the graph to make context-aware recommendations.
4. **Hybrid Approaches**: Combine multiple recommendation strategies for more accurate and diverse suggestions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up your `.env` file with the necessary API keys
4. Run the demo: `python graph_knowledge_demo.py`

## Future Enhancements

- Implement continuous learning and graph updates
- Develop more advanced graph querying capabilities
- Create plugins for popular data analysis tools
- Build a web-based interface for easy exploration of the knowledge graph
